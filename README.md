<h1>Introduction</h1>

This project is a backend system for an online exam platform designed to provide secure and efficient interactions between users and the platform. In the **Accounting** section, **OTP** and **JWT** are used for authentication and enhanced security.  
The **Exam** module supports two main roles: students can take exams, view their scores, and check rankings, while instructors can create and manage exams. Features such as **nested routers** and **throttle** are implemented to optimize performance and improve user experience.  
With a focus on security, scalability, and user-centric design, this system offers a reliable platform for online assessments.
